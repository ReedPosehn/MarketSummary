# Market Summary
Run the bash script to obtain output of the Yahoo Finance market summary. Curl is a dependency.

Requires a Yahoo Finance API Key, which can be obtained upon registering at https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com.
Insert your key into the textfile 'apiKey.txt'.

Inserting a ticker parameter will grab that specific information, ex. "sh MarketSummary.sh AAPL"

Run 'sh MarketSummary.sh' to generate.

#TODO
Split api request out into readable, useful data.
